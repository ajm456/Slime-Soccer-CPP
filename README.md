# Slime Soccer
A C++ version of the Slime Soccer re-make I made in 2015.
This is a re-make of Quin Pendragon's "World Cup Soccer Slime" in order to further my C++ and game development skills. You are welcome to grab the code and compile it yourself, but I make no promises of this repository providing a portable game for you to simply download and play.

# CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT AND INCOMPLETE
